# Payment Gateway
---

A payment gateway is a service that allows businesses to accept online payments securely. Amazon Pay is Amazon's own payment gateway, which allows customers to use their Amazon account information to make purchases on other websites.

When a customer makes a purchase using Amazon Pay, their payment information is securely transmitted to Amazon's servers, where it is processed and verified. The payment is then authorized and the funds are transferred to the merchant's account.

Amazon Pay integrates with various payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, and bank accounts, making it convenient for customers to use. It also provides an added layer of security by using industry-standard encryption and fraud detection measures to protect customers' payment information.

Overall, Amazon Pay helps simplify the payment process for customers and provides merchants with a secure and reliable way to accept online payments.
