Analytics and Monitoring is an important component of Amazon's e-commerce architecture. It involves the use of various tools and services to monitor the performance of the platform and gather insights on customer behavior. These insights help Amazon understand how customers are interacting with its website and products, and enable it to make data-driven decisions to improve the customer experience.

Amazon uses a variety of tools for analytics and monitoring, including Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon Elasticsearch.
