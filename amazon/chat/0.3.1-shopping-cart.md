# Shopping cart
---

A shopping cart is a digital tool used by e-commerce websites to allow customers to select and purchase products or services. It is essentially a virtual basket where customers can add items, adjust quantities, remove items, and view the total cost of their order before proceeding to checkout.

The shopping cart feature is critical to the success of an e-commerce site as it allows customers to browse products, select what they want to buy, and keep track of their selections throughout the purchase process. It also provides a platform for businesses to showcase promotions and offers, such as discounts or free shipping, to encourage customers to make a purchase.

A well-designed shopping cart should be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with clear instructions and visual cues that guide the user through the checkout process. It should also be secure and able to handle multiple payment options, such as credit cards, PayPal, or other electronic payment methods. Additionally, it should be able to handle multiple currencies and tax rates for international transactions.

In addition to the basic functions mentioned earlier, a shopping cart should also provide a seamless and intuitive user experience to ensure customer satisfaction. This includes features such as a prominent and visible cart icon or summary that displays the number of items in the cart, the ability to view and edit the cart at any point during the browsing experience, and a clear and concise checkout process.

To enhance user experience, shopping carts may also offer additional features such as a wishlist or save for later option, the ability to compare products, and the ability to apply promo codes or gift cards. It should also be mobile-friendly and responsive to different devices and screen sizes.

From a technical perspective, a shopping cart must be able to handle multiple requests from different users simultaneously, ensure secure transmission of sensitive information such as payment details, and be integrated with the payment gateway and shipping carrier for a smooth checkout process.

In addition to the basic features, a shopping cart can also include advanced features such as:

- [ ] Wishlists: Allow customers to save products they are interested in and revisit them later.
- [ ] Abandoned cart recovery: Send automated email reminders to customers who have left items in their shopping cart without completing the purchase.
- [ ] Related products: Display related products to customers, based on their browsing history or the items in their shopping cart, to encourage additional purchases.
- [ ] Product recommendations: Suggest products to customers based on their purchase history or browsing behavior, to increase sales and provide a personalized shopping experience.
- [ ] Product reviews: Allow customers to leave reviews and ratings for products they have purchased, which can increase trust and credibility for the store.
- [ ] Multiple shipping addresses: Allow customers to save multiple shipping addresses for faster checkout and convenience.
- [ ] Gift cards: Allow customers to purchase and redeem gift cards, which can increase customer loyalty and drive repeat business.
- [ ] Advanced search: Provide a robust search functionality that allows customers to filter and sort products by various criteria, such as price range, color, brand, etc.
Overall, a well-designed shopping cart can enhance the customer experience, increase sales, and help to build brand loyalty.
