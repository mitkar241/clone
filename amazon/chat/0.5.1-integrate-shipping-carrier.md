# Integrate the shipping carrier
---

Integrating a shipping carrier into your e-commerce website's checkout process is an essential step in providing a smooth and efficient customer experience. Here are the general steps involved in integrating a shipping carrier:

- [ ] Choose the carrier: As mentioned earlier, select a shipping carrier that meets your needs and preferences.
- [ ] Obtain API credentials: You will need to obtain API credentials from the shipping carrier to access their shipping services. This typically involves creating an account with the carrier and obtaining an API key or authorization token.
- [ ] Integrate the API: Integrate the carrier's API into your e-commerce website's checkout process. This involves writing code to interact with the API and pass information such as package weight, dimensions, and destination. The API will then return shipping rates and delivery estimates that can be presented to the customer during checkout.
- [ ] Test the integration: Test the integration to ensure that the shipping rates and delivery estimates provided by the API are accurate and that the checkout process works as expected.
- [ ] Launch the integration: Once you're satisfied with the integration, launch it to the public and make sure to monitor it regularly for any issues or errors.

By integrating a shipping carrier into your e-commerce website, you can provide accurate shipping rates and delivery estimates to your customers and streamline the order fulfillment process.
