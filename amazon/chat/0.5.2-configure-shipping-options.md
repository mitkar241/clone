# Configure shipping options
---

Once you have integrated the shipping carrier into your e-commerce website, you need to configure the shipping options to provide a smooth shipping experience for your customers. Here are the general steps involved in configuring shipping options:

- [ ] Determine shipping rates: You need to determine the shipping rates that you will charge customers. This may be based on product weight, size, destination, or a combination of these factors. You can set up shipping rules in your e-commerce platform's backend that calculate shipping rates based on these factors.
- [ ] Provide shipping options: You can provide customers with different shipping options such as standard, expedited, or next-day delivery. You can also offer package tracking so customers can track their packages in real-time.
- [ ] Set up shipping zones: You may want to set up different shipping zones based on the customer's location. For example, you may want to offer free shipping for customers within a certain distance or region, or charge higher rates for customers outside of your shipping zone.
- [ ] Test the shipping options: Once you have configured the shipping options, test them to ensure that they are working correctly. Test different scenarios such as shipping to different locations, using different shipping methods, and ordering different products.
- [ ] Launch the shipping options: Once you're satisfied with the shipping options, launch them to the public and make sure to monitor them regularly for any issues or errors.

By configuring shipping options in your e-commerce website, you can provide customers with a variety of shipping options and rates that meet their needs and preferences.
