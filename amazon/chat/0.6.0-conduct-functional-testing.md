# Conduct functional testing
---

Functional testing is a type of software testing that involves testing the individual functions of a website or application to ensure that they work correctly. When creating an e-commerce website like an Amazon clone, it's important to conduct functional testing to ensure that all website functions, such as the shopping cart, search function, and checkout process, are working correctly. Here are some key considerations when conducting functional testing:

- [ ] Develop test cases: Develop a set of test cases that cover all website functions. These test cases should include inputs and expected outputs, and should be designed to test all possible scenarios.
- [ ] Conduct manual testing: Conduct manual testing by going through the website and testing each function manually. This may involve using a test script to ensure that all steps are followed correctly.
- [ ] Conduct automated testing: Use automated testing tools to conduct testing more efficiently. Automated testing tools can simulate user behavior and can be used to test large amounts of data.
- [ ] Use testing frameworks: Use testing frameworks, such as Selenium or Appium, to conduct automated testing. Testing frameworks can help to streamline the testing process and can provide more accurate results.
- [ ] Record and report issues: Record any issues or bugs that are discovered during testing, and report them to the development team for resolution. It's important to provide detailed descriptions of the issues, including steps to reproduce them and any error messages that were displayed.

By conducting thorough functional testing, you can ensure that all website functions are working correctly and are ready for use by customers. Regular testing can help to identify issues and bugs before they become major problems, and can help to ensure that the website remains stable and reliable over time.
