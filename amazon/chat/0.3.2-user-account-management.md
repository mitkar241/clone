# User account management
---

User account management is an important component of an e-commerce website as it provides users with a personalized experience and makes it easier for them to make purchases. Users should be able to create an account easily and securely, and the account management functionality should be easy to navigate.

Once a user has created an account, they should be able to view their order history and track their shipments. The user account management functionality should also allow users to save their payment and shipping information for future purchases, making the checkout process faster and more convenient.

Security is also an important consideration when it comes to user account management. Users' personal information should be stored securely, and there should be options for resetting passwords and managing account security settings.

Overall, a well-designed and secure user account management system is essential for providing users with a positive experience and encouraging repeat business.

In addition to the basic functionalities mentioned earlier, user account management should also include features such as:

- [ ] Wishlists: Customers should be able to add products to their wishlist for future purchase or reference.
- [ ] Order tracking: Customers should be able to track the status of their orders, view order history, and receive notifications regarding their order status.
- [ ] Personalization: User accounts can also offer personalized experiences such as recommended products based on the customer's purchase history or saved preferences.
- [ ] Loyalty programs: User accounts can also be used to track loyalty points or rewards earned by customers for their purchases, encouraging repeat business.
- [ ] Social login: User accounts can also offer the option for customers to log in using their social media accounts, making the process easier and more convenient.

Overall, user account management should be a seamless and secure experience for customers, encouraging them to return to the website for future purchases.
