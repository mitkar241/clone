When choosing an e-commerce platform, it's essential to consider factors such as your budget, the level of customization you require, the number of products you plan to sell, and the level of technical expertise you have available. You should also consider the scalability of the platform, as you may need to expand your website as your business grows.

To add to the above, here are some additional points to consider when choosing an e-commerce platform:

- [ ] Support and community: Look for platforms that offer a strong support system and community, as this can be invaluable in troubleshooting issues or getting help with customization.
- [ ] Cost: Consider the cost of the platform and any associated fees, such as transaction fees or hosting fees. Make sure to choose a platform that fits within your budget and offers good value for money.
