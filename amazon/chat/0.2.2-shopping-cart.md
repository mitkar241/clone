# Shopping cart
---

In addition to the basic features mentioned, a good shopping cart should also be able to handle complex calculations, such as applying discounts or coupon codes, calculating taxes and shipping costs based on the customer's location, and adjusting the total price when items are added or removed. The shopping cart should also be able to remember items that have been added to the cart so that customers can easily pick up where they left off if they return to the site at a later time. It's also important that the shopping cart be mobile-friendly and accessible on all types of devices, as many customers will be shopping on their phones or tablets.

In addition to the basic functionalities mentioned earlier, a well-designed shopping cart should also have the following features:

- [ ] Ability to save cart: Customers may not always have the time or inclination to complete their purchase in one sitting. Therefore, having the option to save their cart and come back to it at a later time is a convenient feature that can improve the overall shopping experience.
- [ ] Quantity adjustment: Customers should be able to easily adjust the quantity of items in their cart or remove items altogether.
- [ ] Cross-sell and upsell: The shopping cart is a great place to recommend related or complementary products that customers may be interested in purchasing. This can increase the average order value and overall revenue.
- [ ] Cart abandonment recovery: Unfortunately, not all customers will complete their purchase. Therefore, having a system in place to recover abandoned carts, such as sending reminder emails or offering a discount, can help win back some of those lost sales.

Multiple payment options: The shopping cart should also provide multiple payment options, including credit/debit cards, PayPal, and other payment gateways. This can increase the likelihood of customers completing their purchase by providing them with the payment method that they prefer.
